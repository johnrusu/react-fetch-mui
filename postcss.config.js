// postcss.config.js
// This file configures PostCSS to use Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer.
// It is used to process CSS files in the project, applying Tailwind's utility classes and
// ensuring compatibility with various browsers through Autoprefixer.
// The plugins are loaded in the order they are specified, with Tailwind CSS being processed first
// followed by Autoprefixer.
// Make sure to install the necessary dependencies:
// npm install tailwindcss autoprefixer postcss --save-dev
// You can also use `npx tailwindcss init` to create a Tailwind configuration file if you haven't done so already.
// This configuration is essential for projects using Tailwind CSS to ensure
// that the styles are generated correctly and that the CSS is optimized for production use.
// For more information on configuring PostCSS, refer to the official documentation:
// https://postcss.org/
// For Tailwind CSS, refer to: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation
// For Autoprefixer, refer to: https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer
// This file should be placed in the root of your project or in the same directory as your CSS files.
// Ensure that your build process includes PostCSS to apply these configurations.
